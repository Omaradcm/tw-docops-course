# Omar's README file

Hi! This is a README file about me for DocOps Introductory Course. I'm from Morelia, a small city about 3.5 hours from Guadalajara. Last August, I started my career as a Technical Writer. I enjoy learning new things, and my hobbies are reading and watching movies and series. I have two dogs: 

- Luca
- Petra

The thing they enjoy the most are:

1. Eating
2. Sleeping
3. Walking

A little bit of more information about them:

| |Breed|Age|Color|Gender|

|Petra|American Pitbull|7 years old|Brown|Female|
